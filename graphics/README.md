[1,084 days: How Toy Story 3 was made](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/how-toy-story-3-was-made#:~:text=Rendering%20%2D%2D%20using%20computer%20algorithms,39%20hours%20of%20computing%20time.)

Toy Story was the first fully computer-animated movie, but just because it was animated entirely by computers doesn’t mean it was any less labor intensive. The process of creating a 3D animated movie like Toy Story involves: coming up with the story and drafting the script, sketching storyboards, digitizing images, sculpting characters out of clay, turning the storyboard into a flip book, recording voice actors, animating characters’ faces based on the voice actors performances, shading in the digital images, rendering images to create a final frame, mixing audio, and more. Most surprisingly, the average frame (a movie has 24 frames per second) takes about seven hours to render, although some can take nearly 39 hours of computing time). I would incorporate this into a lesson to underscore how much time it takes to create 2 hours worth of animated content. I would have students brainstorm ways to make this process more efficient both in terms of time and computing power.
