Even Snapchat is getting in on the ray tracing action! Snapchat’s “Lens Studio” will soon support ray tracing, which will allow its games and animations to simulate more accurate lighting, reflection, refraction, and shadows. You can already use your phone to try on virtual glasses and now you can look forward to “trying on” realistic looking jewelry. No need to buy a 10k engagement ring, Snapchat’s collaboration with Tiffany-and-Co has you covered.
