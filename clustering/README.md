You probably know that when you log into Netflix, the shows and movies recommended to you are customized based on your viewing activity. But did you know that even the thumbnails you see are customized to you? (Source: Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine)

Netflix estimates that users spend 1.8 seconds deciding on a title and found that users are most influenced by thumbnails. Netflix uses neural nets to predict which thumbnails you will find most engaging based on your previous selections. For example, if you tend to watch comedy shows you might see a different thumbnail for the movie Good Will Hunting than someone who loves romantic movies (Source: [Vox]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axCBA3VD5dQ>).

Using a neural net improves the efficiency of Netflix’s recommendation algorithm because it tailors not only the recommendations it gives users but HOW they are being recommended in the first place. It is the equivalent of convincing two friends to go to an event with you by telling your foodie friend that the event will be catered by a famous chef and your influencer friend that there will be famous celebrities there. Ultimately, you’re recommending the same event to your two friends but piquing their interest in different ways. 

As it exists now, I don’t think this particular neural network or recommendation algorithm is unethical but it definitely influences human behavior.
