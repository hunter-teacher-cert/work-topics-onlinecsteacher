#### Playfair Cipher

The Playfair cipher is an encryption method that pairs together letters from the original message in order to encrypt them. It relies on a 5x5 square where letters are entered either alphabetically (usually omitting the J) or according to a given code.

The basic rules are as follows:

1. Pair off each letter (for any standalone letter assign it an additional bogus letter)
2. **If both letters are in the same column** — take the letter directly under each letter in the 5x5 grid
3. **If both the letters are in the same row** — take the letter to the right of each one (wraparound as needed)
4. **If neither of the above rules is true** — form a rectangle with the two letters and take the letters on the horizontal opposite corner of the rectangle.

Fun fact: The Playfair cipher was used by British forces in WWI, Australians in WWII, and by JFK in 1943 when his military boat was crashed into by a Japanese destroyer.
