PurpleThrone is “an online music distribution platform…helping artists thrive independently based on funding from the PurpleCoin cryptocurrency”.

**Potential benefits**:
To be perfectly honest I’m not entirely sure what this project is but in theory it sounds beneficial for musical artists. Musicians who (pay to) upload their music to the platform can collect royalties more easily and top performers have access to: concerts, festivals, video production, photoshoots, dance choreography, image consultation (:thinking_face:), and good old fashioned fiat currency.

**Potential problems**:
In practice, it seems like a Fyre Fest scam backed by cryptocurrency, where if you invest enough money you can receive a PurpleCoin Medallion. So for upwards of $999 you can pay real money to invest in ethereum and get a fancy necklace for your purchase that you can use as a token to buy music. It seems like the adult equivalent of going to an arcade and trading your real quarters in for fake arcade quarters to play games and ultimately win cheap doo-dads. But with PurpleThrone you don’t even get to play skeeball!

Overall, I’m excited to see if this project goes anywhere or at least opens up a discussion about increasing royalties.
